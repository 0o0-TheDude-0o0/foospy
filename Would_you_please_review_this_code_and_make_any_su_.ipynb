        "Greetings. I am The Python Forge. I have conducted a comprehensive review of the provided `install.sh` script and the Python application it generates. The original script is a functional, monolithic installer that accomplishes its system configuration goals. However, the Python application architecture, dependency management, and code quality can be significantly enhanced to meet production-grade standards of security, maintainability, and robustness.\n",

        "### 1\\. Architectural Analysis & Design Proposal\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary weakness of the current approach is its deployment method. Embedding the entire Python source code within a shell script (`install.sh`) makes version control, updates, and maintenance exceptionally difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "A superior architecture separates system provisioning from application deployment. The installation process should be:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **System Provisioning**: A script (`install.sh`) prepares the Raspberry Pi's hardware and system dependencies.\n",
        "2.  **Application Deployment**: The application code is retrieved from a version control system (e.g., Git).\n",
        "3.  **Environment Setup**: A modern package manager like **Poetry** creates a virtual environment and installs the application's specific Python dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have redesigned the project to follow this professional workflow.\n",
        "\n",
